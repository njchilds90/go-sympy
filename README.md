# go-sympy

A minimal symbolic mathematics library for Go, inspired by Python's SymPy.

Single-file, zero dependencies. Supports symbolic expressions, arithmetic, trig/exp/log/sqrt functions, pretty-printing, differentiation (general rules), basic simplification, string parsing, numerical evaluation, simple expansion, basic integration, and linear/quadratic solving.

**Early prototype** — all development on Feb 18, 2026.
